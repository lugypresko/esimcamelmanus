- **Body Text:** A clean, readable sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Lato) for optimal legibility.

## 4. Layout & Composition

## 5. Visual Elements

- **Rounded Corners:** All cards, buttons, and input fields will have significantly rounded corners to create a soft and friendly aesthetic.
- **Drop Shadows:** Subtle drop shadows will be used to lift elements off the page and create a sense of depth.
- **Playful Icons:** The existing Lucide icons will be retained, but their presentation will be updated to match the new, more playful style.
- **Organic Shapes:** The background will feature large, organic, blob-like shapes in the primary purple color to create a visually interesting and branded backdrop.
