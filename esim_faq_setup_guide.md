# 📚 eSIM Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. **What is an eSIM?**
An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital version of a SIM card that is built directly into your phone. You don't need to insert anything physically. With eSIM, you can activate a mobile plan by simply scanning a QR code or entering an activation code, making it easy to switch plans or add new ones without changing physical cards.

### 2. **How do I know if my phone supports eSIM?**
You can check in your phone settings: 
- On iPhone: Go to **Settings > Mobile Data > Add eSIM**
- On Android: Go to **Settings > Connections > SIM Manager**
If you see the option to add an eSIM, your device is compatible. You can also check your device model against our compatibility list.

### 3. **Can I use eSIM and my physical SIM at the same time?**
Yes. Most modern phones support Dual SIM mode, where you can have one physical SIM and one eSIM active at the same time. This is useful if you want to keep your local number while using the eSIM for data when traveling.

### 4. **How do I install the eSIM?**
You can install the eSIM by scanning the QR code we send you or by manually entering the provided activation details. You’ll find the installation option in your phone settings under "Add eSIM" or "SIM Manager." Full installation steps are available in our guide.

### 5. **What happens if I delete my eSIM by mistake?**
In most cases, eSIM profiles cannot be re-downloaded. If you delete it, you will likely need to purchase a new eSIM. Contact our support team to check if there’s a possibility to recover your profile.

### 6. **Can I reuse my eSIM for my next trip?**
No. Most travel eSIMs are for single use and expire once you finish your data package or reach the expiration date. For your next trip, you will need to purchase a new eSIM package.

### 7. **Do I need an internet connection to install the eSIM?**
Yes, you must have Wi-Fi or mobile data active to download the eSIM profile to your phone. We recommend being connected to a stable Wi-Fi network during installation.

### 8. **Can I make phone calls with my eSIM?**
Most eSIMs we offer are data-only, meaning they don’t provide a traditional phone number for voice calls or SMS. You can use internet-based apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, or Skype for calling and messaging.

### 9. **How do I switch between my eSIM and my local SIM?**
You can easily switch by going to your phone settings:
- iPhone: **Settings > Mobile Data > Mobile Data Switching**
- Android: **Settings > SIM Manager > Preferred SIM for Data/Calls**
Choose which SIM you want to use for mobile data and calls at any time.

### 10. **What should I do if my eSIM isn’t working?**
First, make sure the eSIM is selected as the active data SIM in your settings. Check that mobile data is turned on and that roaming is enabled. Try restarting your phone. If you still can’t connect, try manually selecting a network. If the problem continues, contact our support team.

### 11. **How long does it take to activate the eSIM?**
Activation is usually instant after you install the eSIM. Sometimes it can take a few minutes for the network to recognize the new profile. If it takes longer than 15 minutes, try restarting your phone or contact support.

### 12. **Can I share my eSIM data with other devices (hotspot)?**
Yes. Most of our eSIM packages allow you to share your internet connection via hotspot or tethering, just like a regular SIM card. Check your plan details to confirm this feature.

### 13. **Does the eSIM come with a phone number?**
Usually, our travel eSIMs are data-only and don’t come with a phone number for voice calls or SMS. If you need voice services, you’ll need to use apps like WhatsApp or choose a specific plan that includes calling.

### 14. **Will my eSIM work in multiple countries?**
Some of our eSIMs are country-specific, while others cover entire regions or even offer global plans. Always check your plan’s coverage before you buy to ensure it works in all your planned destinations.

### 15. **Do I need to remove my eSIM after my trip?**
You can either delete the eSIM from your phone or simply disable it in your settings. Leaving it installed will not affect your device or your local SIM. If you plan to travel again soon, you can keep it for reference.
